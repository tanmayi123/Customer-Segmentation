# Customer-Segmentation
Customer Segmentation using RFM Analysis
This project focuses on **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis** to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior. The analysis begins with a detailed **data preprocessing step**, which involves loading an eCommerce dataset, cleaning missing and duplicate values, and preparing additional features like `TotalPrice` by multiplying `Quantity` and `UnitPrice`. The notebook ensures that the data is ready for analysis by converting dates and verifying data types, laying the groundwork for subsequent calculations.

Next, the **RFM metrics are calculated**, grouping customers by their ID to compute Recency (days since the last purchase), Frequency (number of purchases), and Monetary (total amount spent). These metrics are scored using quartiles to assign RFM scores, which help classify customers into distinct segments. The notebook uses clustering techniques, specifically K-Means, to group customers into clusters based on their RFM scores. The data is normalized before clustering to ensure accurate segmentation.

in the project, the code then delves into **customer segmentation and profiling**, where each cluster is analyzed to identify characteristics of customer groups. For instance, clusters might include high-value customers (Champions), recently lost customers, or infrequent spenders. Marketing recommendations tailored to each cluster are outlined, such as loyalty programs for high-value customers or discounts to reactivate lapsed customers. The notebook emphasizes actionable insights for businesses to enhance customer engagement and profitability.

Finally, **visualizations** play a crucial role in interpreting the results. Techniques such as pie charts to show cluster sizes, 3D scatter plots for visualizing clusters, and box plots to compare metrics like Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) across clusters are implemented. These visualizations provide a clear representation of the segmentation results and highlight the business implications of the analysis. Overall, the project serves as a comprehensive guide for leveraging RFM analysis and clustering to derive data-driven customer insights.
